The goal of <span style="color: #1d365e;">**nefishr***</span> is to
provide a suite of functions that help to produce fishery reports,
presentations, and other documents for each of the different Fishery
Management Plans (FMPs).

 **This package is in active development, and should be used sparingly.*

## Installation

You can install the development version of nefishr from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("MarisCollaborative/nefishr")
```

<!-- ## Example
&#10;This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:
&#10;
``` r
library(nefishr)
## basic example code
```
&#10;What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:
&#10;
``` r
summary(cars)
#>      speed           dist       
#>  Min.   : 4.0   Min.   :  2.00  
#>  1st Qu.:12.0   1st Qu.: 26.00  
#>  Median :15.0   Median : 36.00  
#>  Mean   :15.4   Mean   : 42.98  
#>  3rd Qu.:19.0   3rd Qu.: 56.00  
#>  Max.   :25.0   Max.   :120.00
```
&#10;You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.
&#10;You can also embed plots, for example:
&#10;<img src="man/figures/README-pressure-1.png" alt="" width="100%" />
&#10;In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.-->
